        <h1 class="ahead">Inspiration Ahead</h1><br><br>
        <p class="words">It stems from our value of “Benfen”, asking us to do the right thing and keep an open mind as we strive to seek truth. It is also rooted in our product history: from our first mobile phone – “Smiley Face” – in 2008, OPPO has been in relentless
            pursuit of spreading optimism and inspiration to the world with technology. <br><br> “Inspiration Ahead” is OPPO’s attitude towards the current state of the world, and is also shared by the group of people that OPPO wants to empower. <br>
            <br> The current age is full of challenges and uncertainty. To believe in “Inspiration Ahead” is to believe that the future is promising. Just as we encourage everyone to brave the difficulties, OPPO will stick to the right thing and never
            sacrifice quality for speed. <br><br> OPPO identifies with the vast number of our fellows. We hope to empower them and elevate the society with innovation and technology, and to make a difference and to find inspiration ahead</p>
